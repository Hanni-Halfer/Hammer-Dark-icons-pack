//////////////// Note ////////////////

This is just an icon pack for your dark windows themes.
To change the windows theme you need a tool like the ThemeTool SecureUxTheme or UXThemePatcher.
Make sure to create a system restore point before using these tools and make sure the theme supports your current windows version.

To go back to the OG Hammer++ icons just replace the dll with the Original dll for the game you're using Hammer++ for -> https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/download.html
This dll is from Hammer++ version 8869, make sure to use the right one!
